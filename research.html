        <p>My research focuses on social isolation among older adults, religious attendance, and religious struggles. I have also explored topics like social network behavior, well-being, and psychological statistics. I believe that interdisciplinary research is key to addressing complex societal issues, and I am deeply committed to contributing to the fields of psychology, sociology, and behavioral oncology through my work.

            <h2>Specific Research Interests</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Social network behavior and mental health</strong></p>
<p>Social network behavior involves how individuals engage with online platforms, such as passive or active usage. Research explores the impact of social media on mental health, including emotional well-being, life satisfaction, and issues like depression and anxiety, with a focus on comparisons across different cultural contexts.</p>

<p><strong>2. Religion and mental health</strong></p>
<p>Religion plays a significant role in shaping mental health through spiritual beliefs, community support, and coping mechanisms. This area of study examines how religious practices, struggles, and support influence factors like loneliness, stress, and overall psychological well-being, particularly during challenging life events.</p>

<p><strong>3. Social isolation and mental health</strong></p>
<p>Social isolation refers to the lack of social connections, which can negatively affect mental health. This topic investigates the relationship between isolation and issues such as depression, anxiety, and decreased life satisfaction, with a focus on vulnerable populations, such as older adults, and the moderating effects of gender and race/ethnicity.</p>
